MCP9808 Temperature Sensor Library for the Raspberry Pi.
===================

Python module for the [MCP9808 temperature sensor breakout](http://www.adafruit.com/product/1782) from Adafruit (a steal at $4.95) for use on the Raspberry Pi through I2C. This module is a port of the [Adafruit MCP9080 Library](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-mcp9808-precision-i2c-temperature-sensor-guide/overview) for Arduino. I made it for personal use, and make no promises on further development. However, feel to use it as you see fit. 


UPDATE:
-------
Adafruit now has their own [MCP9808 Python module](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_Python_MCP9808).
